# Hello, Svelte

For a long time now I have been using Vue.js to make dynamic apps in JavaScript but I have been hearing about this package called `svelte` which compiles down to pure JavaScript. I *love* the sound of that, so let's try things out here.

To get started, follow the directions on the Svelte homepage and then dive into the examples provided here:

    https://svelte.dev/examples

For today's exercise I worked through the first parts of the examples - up to the logic section. It would be nice to do the entire set of examples.

The compile process is very fast. It feels nice.

Additionally, the creators of Svelte have also published `Sapper` which is a tool for making multi-page Svelte projects, similar to next.js and nuxt.js.

Interestingly Svelte recommends `npm` and not `yarn` because it makes use of the `package.lock` file. I feel like this should be done with `npm-shrinkwrap`.
