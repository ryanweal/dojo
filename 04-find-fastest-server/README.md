# 04 - find fastest server

This is a dojo series of small non-project related code.

Today's challenge is to create a node.js console application that takes in two
URLs and does a speed comparison between them. This could be used to determine
which of the two servers is closer to you for making subsequent requests.

    Suggested usage: node index.js --url1=http://example.com --url2=https://example.net
